title:  "LLM Coding Review"
date:   2024-05-31 11:15:00 -0500
categories: eurAIka update
---
The Large Language Model (LLM) landscape is evolving very rapidly and it's hard to keep up with developments, especially as a non-expert in the field. For now, we're going to provide an overview of projects and papers that may be relevant to the eurAIka project recognizing that some paths will be dead ends and new ideas will come out after publication of this note.

One project that seems very promising is [OpenDevin](https://opendevin.github.io/OpenDevin/) an open-source autonomous AI software agent aimed at writing and testing code based on natural language instructions from the software engineer. See: *[Mastering OpenDevin: Your Gateway to Efficient and Empowered Coding](https://medium.com/@ivarnyc/mastering-opendevin-your-gateway-to-efficient-and-empowered-coding-ba14df72a2bf)*. Our goals may be slightly different because we're more interested in code that provides insight than elegantly written code. The eurAIka coder is meant to give answers to scientific problems and the quality of the code is a secondary concern. 

Below are possible useful ideas for The Coder, separated into concept categories and listed in alphabetical order. Each listed concept or tool provides a link to an external website and a short description. A good reference is *[State of Open Source AI Book - 2023 Edition](https://book.premai.io/state-of-open-source-ai/)*.
