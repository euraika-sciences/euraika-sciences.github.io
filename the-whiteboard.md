# ![eurAIka-logo-small](/assets/img/site/eurAIka-logo-small.webp) The Whiteboard

**The Whiteboard** is a platform for outlining concepts, working through ideas visually, and managing project workflow like a traditional whiteboard. It understands mathematical equations and can insert figures and citations.

- Visually map out concepts and project workflow like a traditional whiteboard
- Insert equations, figures, and citations seamlessly
- Perform [calculations](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code), including [symbolic manipulations](https://wxmaxima-developers.github.io/wxmaxima/)
- Maintain a knowledge base of [bookmarks and notes](https://github.com/PKM-er/Obsidian-Surfing)
- Leverage AI to act as a subject matter expert and [aid discovery](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot)
- Collaborate with remote teams in real-time with [integrated video chat](https://jitsi.org/)
- Simple [sketches](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to [CAD level drawings](https://github.com/kryptokommunist/Jupyter_FreeCAD)
- [Agent-based AI](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/) rapidly converges to plausible solutions
- Publish to your [GitHub account](https://mindstone.tuancao.me/)
- Open a new Whiteboard worksheet with *Ctrl-N*. Work is automatically saved locally.

Each project is given a unique name such as "Airborne Virus Transmission" and is automatically stored in an Obsidian vault so you never have to worry about losing any of your work. Write equations in LaTeX, and have them automatically numbered and referenced by **eurAIka**. Figures are similarly numbered and referenced. You can insert graphics from **The Coder** directly into your project, or select from locally stored images.

**The Whiteboard** connects to your bibliographic reference manager to easily drop citations into your document. **The Whiteboard** searches through your document for keywords and links them to other documents in your vault to form a [Zettlekasten](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/), or note card system, which you may view graphically as a [ZettleFlow](https://github.com/RafaelGB/Obsidian-ZettelFlow).

Give the chatGPT interface a natural language prompt to generate formatted LaTeX, or ask it to solve an equation written in LaTeX. The results may be dropped directly into **The Whiteboard**.
