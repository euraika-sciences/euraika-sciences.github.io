**How customizable is it? Can users train models on their own data?**

- Models are fully customizable and may be trained on user data.

**What are the hardware requirements? Does it require a high-end GPU for the AI components?**

- There are no specific hardware requirements. Any relatively new computer with a standard GPU is sufficient. Better computing capabilities extend the capabilities of the software.

**What languages/frameworks does The Coder support? Python, R, MATLAB, etc.**

- Currently languages that are directly supported in JupyterLab are the Lean Theorem Prover, Julia, Octave/Matlab, Python, R, and Wolfram Language. Any language with a [Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) may be included, and others are planned.

**How is user data handled? Is it stored locally or in the cloud? What about privacy/security?**

- All user data is maintained locally to maintain privacy and security, unless the user opts for cloud storage. 

**Can it integrate with existing tools like lab equipment, databases, or other software?** 

- **eurAIka** can work alongside any user equipment, databases or software. If there is no direct interoperability, then results and figures may be imported, but the goal will be to connect to virtually any scientific software.

**Is there a mobile app in addition to desktop? This may help collaborate on the go.**

- There is no mobile app at the moment.

**What does the collaboration look like in practice? Is it real-time editing or taking turns?**

- Collaboration is done in real-time, just as if scientists were standing around a whiteboard discussing a problem.

**How refined are the AI models? Should users expect missteps or errors?**

- The AI models are run on current state-of-art systems such as Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Bing AI and others. If users want additional security or privacy the AI models may be installed locally.

**What is the roadmap for future development? How will capabilities grow over time?**

- Future development will be based on user requirements. The product relies on many tools built by others such as the Strut writing assistant which have free and paid levels. **eurAIka** is expected to evolve to include similar capabilities offered as open-source.

**Is it free to use?** 

- In order to make science accessible to anyone, **eurAIka** will always be free to use. If a user wishes to include proprietary software such as Matlab rather than the open-source equivalent Octave, they will have to pay for that software. 

**Is there IT support offered if users have trouble setting it up or using features?**

- There is no direct IT support, but installation should be straightforward for any platform and operating system. We expect a user community to develop around the product.

**In the eurAIka interface picture above, the area for The Coder seems too small to work in. Is there a way to expand it?**

- Yes, each pane can be resized to fill the entire window using *Alt-F*. Restore it to the original size by pressing *Esc*. You may also drag the borders of any pane to resize it, or move the entire pane to a new location. Many commands in **eurAIka** are controlled by similar hotkeys and all can be re-mapped however you find convenient.

**Is eurAIka ready for me to use?**

- We're not quite ready to release **eurAIka** yet. The project is under very active development and most features listed here work, but a few things remain on our TODO list:
  - Integrating agent-based research
  - Building the journal article [recommendation system](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/11/2/81)
  - Create the [RAG/Fusion](RAG/Fusion) element for **The Coder**
  - Make an installer for all major operating systems to reduce user overhead
  - Smooth a few rough edges!
